this is a long english sample tejt meant for a laboratory assignment on encryption decryption and cracking using frequency analysis the purpose of the tejt is to provide enough characters so that after preprocessing the encrypted tejt will have at least one thousand characters the tejt uses only letters and spaces so punctuation removal will not change it the message repeats ideas in different ways to increase length while keeping meaning clear you can keep reading as a continuous paragraph and it will still work as input for the program

in this tejt we describe simple topics such as studying in a computer lab writing code in python working with files and practicing careful steps we read a tejt file we choose a key we encrypt the message and we write the encrypted output to another file after that we can decrypt the encrypted tejt using the same key and verify that the result matches the original prepared tejt the cracking program will try to recover readable english by analyzing how often letters appear and by checking words against a dictionary long words are more reliable than short words and the correction step must only be accepted when the number of recognized words increases

the tejt continues to ensure sufficient size for testing the cracking procedure we mention common words and patterns that appear in english such as the and of to in that is with for on as by from at and more the cracking algorithm will see these patterns in letter frequencies and will attempt substitutions it may not be perfect on the first pass so the correction step will try swaps in the guessed mapping and will keep only improvements measured by recognized long words in the dictionary this repeated description ensures the file is large enough for the assignment and ready to use
